            Water quality index (WQI) is one of the most used tools to describe water quality. It is based on physical,
            chemical, and biological factors that are combined into a single value that ranges from 0 to 100 and
            involves 4
            processes: (1) parameter selection, (2) transformation of the raw data into common scale, (3) providing
            weights
            and (4) aggregation of sub-index values. The background of WQI is presented in this review study. the stages
            of
            development, the progression of the field of study, the various WQIs, the benefits and drawbacks of each
            approach, and the most recent attempts at WQI studies. In order to grow and elaborate the index in several
            ways,
            WQIs should be linked to scientific breakthroughs (example: ecologically). Consequently, a sophisticated WQI
            that takes into account statistical methods, interactions between parameters, and scientific and
            technological
            improvement should be created in order to be used in future investigations.

        <div class="para2">
            An air quality index (AQI) is an indicator developed by government agencies[1] to communicate to the public
            how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become.[2][3] As air pollution levels
            rise, so does the AQI, along with the associated public health risk. Children, the elderly and individuals
            with respiratory or cardiovascular problems are typically the first groups affected by poor air quality.
            When the AQI is high, governmental bodies generally encourage people to reduce physical activity outdoors,
            or even avoid going out altogether. When wildfires result in a high AQI, the use of a mask (such as an N95
            respirator) outdoors and an air purifier (incorporating both HEPA and activated carbon filters) indoors are
            also encouraged.[4][5]

            Different countries have their own air quality indices, corresponding to different national air quality
            standards. Some of these are Canada's Air Quality Health Index, Malaysia's Air Pollution Index, and
            Singapore's Pollutant Standards Index.
